    "This workshop has provided a hands-on introduction to Power BI desktop, highlighting its simplicity and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have explored the crucial steps in creating a robust model, including importing and cleaning data with Power Query, building a star schema model, and creating measures to analyze data. We also learned how to create a simple report using the three primary views: model, data, and report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The star schema model proved to be an essential component in building an efficient and effective data model. Its ability to simplify complex data structures and improve query performance was highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have only scratched the surface of Power BI's capabilities, and the next logical step is to explore Power BI service to share and collaborate on our reports. With Power BI service, we can publish our reports, create dashboards, and enable collaboration among team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this workshop demonstrated the power and versatility of Power BI and how it can help organizations make better decisions by leveraging their data. We hope that you found this workshop informative and valuable, and we encourage you to continue exploring the possibilities of Power BI.\n"
